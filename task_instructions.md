The Problem - Online Bookstore
------------------------------

We need a system for managing the **inventory** and **purchase process** of an online bookstore. The system should provide the following primary functions:

1.  **Inventory management of books**
    
2.  **Purchase processing and book pricing**
    
3.  **Tracking customer loyalty points**
    

### Pricing Rules

The final purchasing price is modified according to the following factors:

*   **Book Type**
    
*   **Purchase Size**
    
*   **Loyalty Points**
    

#### Book Types

*   **New Releases**: The price is always **100%** of the base price.
    
*   **Regular Books**: The price is **100%** of the base price but can be reduced by **10%** if purchased in a **bundle of 3 books or more**.
    
*   **Old Editions**: The price is **discounted by 20%**. If purchased in a **bundle of 3 books or more**, an **additional 5% discount** applies.
    

#### Loyalty Points System

*   Customers earn **1 loyalty point** for every book purchased.
    
*   Once **10 loyalty points** are accumulated, the customer can redeem them for **one free Regular or Old Edition book**.
    
*   After redeeming the discount, the loyalty points reset to **0**.
    

### API Requirements

The system should expose a **RESTful HTTP API** that supports the following operations:

*   **Retrieve available books for purchase**
    
*   **Buy one or multiple books and calculate the total price**
    
*   **Retrieve customer loyalty points**
